                                        <b>Abstract:</b> Path-based explanations provide intrinsic insights into
                                        graph-based recommendation models. However, most previous work has focused on
                                        explaining an individual recommendation of an item to a user. In this paper, we
                                        propose summary explanations, i.e., explanations that highlight why a user or a
                                        group of users receive a set of item recommendations and why an item, or a group
                                        of items, is recommended to a set of users as an effective means to provide
                                        insights into the collective behavior of the recommender. We also present a
                                        novel method to summarize explanations using efficient graph algorithms,
                                        specifically the Steiner Tree and the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree. Our
                                        approach reduces the size and complexity of summary explanations while
                                        preserving essential information, making explanations more comprehensible for
                                        users and more useful to model developers. Evaluations across multiple metrics
                                        demonstrate that our summaries outperform baseline explanation methods in most
                                        scenarios, in a variety of quality aspects.

                                        <b>Abstract:</b> The exact evaluation of queries over knowledge graphs encoded
                                        as RDF data has been extensively studied. However, in a wide
                                        array of applications, RDF queries do not even terminate, due to
                                        performance reasons. Notably, queries on public SPARQL endpoints are oftentimes
                                        timed out without returning any results.
                                        To address this, we propose a novel solution to the problem of
                                        progressive query answering and introduce the PING system that implements it on
                                        top of SPARK. In our approach, graph query answering leverages a hierarchical
                                        structure, which facilitates effective data partitioning, thus allowing us to
                                        reduce the sizes of intermediate results and return progressive answers.
                                        Moreover, it allows the RDF query evaluation algorithms to directly locate and
                                        access the different hierarchy levels required for query answering. Navigating
                                        through the hierarchy levels allows expanding or shrinking query results at
                                        different granularities. The extensive experimental study on real-world graph
                                        datasets, with varied query workloads, shows PINGâ€™s effectiveness and
                                        efficiency, on both exact and progressive query answering, and its superiority
                                        to the most relevant baselines.<br />

                                        <b>Abstract:</b> When the focus is on the relationships or interactions between
                                        entities, graphs offer an intuitive model for many real-world
                                        data. Such graphs are usually large and change over time, thus, requiring models
                                        and strategies that explore their evolution. We study the evolution of aggregate
                                        graphs and introduce the GraphTempo model that allows temporal and graph
                                        aggregation not only on node level by grouping individual nodes, but on a
                                        pattern level as well, where subgraphs are grouped together. Furthermore, we
                                        propose an efficient strategy for exploring the evolution of the graph based on
                                        identifying time intervals of significant growth, shrinkage, or stability.
                                        Finally, we evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach
                                        using four real graphs. https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2024.3410647<br />

                                        on top of relational databases. To come up with these timing
                                        patterns, we have studied 151 projects of a public dataset of
                                        schema histories, with duration more than 12 months. The eight
                                        timing patterns of schema evolution are largely grouped in 3

                                        The generation of voluminous scientific data poses significant challenges for
                                        efficient storage, transfer, and analysis. Recently, error-bounded lossy
                                        compression methods emerged due to their ability to achieve high compression
                                        ratios while controlling data distortion. However, they often overlook the
                                        inherent spatial and temporal correlations within scientific data, thus missing
                                        opportunities for higher compression. In this paper we propose GRAPHCOMP, a
                                        novel graph-based method for error-bounded lossy compression of scientific data.
                                        We perform irregular segmentation of the original grid data and generate a graph
                                        representation that preserves the spatial and temporal correlations. Inspired by
                                        Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we then propose a temporal graph autoencoder to
                                        learn latent representations that significantly reduce the size of the graph,
                                        effectively compressing the original data. Decompression reverses the process
                                        and utilizes the learnt graph model together with the latent representation to
                                        reconstruct an approximation of the original data. The decompressed data are
                                        guaranteed to satisfy a user-defined point-wise error bound. We compare our
                                        method against the state-of-the-art error-bounded lossy methods (i.e., HPEZ,
                                        SZ3.1, SPERR, and ZFP) on large-scale real and synthetic data. GRAPHCOMP
                                        consistently achieves the highest compression ratio across most datasets,
                                        outperforming the second-best method by margins ranging from 22% to 50%.<br />

                                        <b>Abstract:</b> A recent trend in stream processing is offloading the
                                        computation
                                        of decomposable aggregation functions (DAF) from cloud nodes to
                                        geo-distributed fog/edge devices to decrease latency and improve
                                        energy efficiency. However, deploying DAFs on low-end devices
                                        is challenging due to their volatility and limited resources. Addi-
                                        tionally, in geo-distributed fog/edge environments, creating new
                                        operator instances on demand and replicating operators ubiqui-
                                        tously is restricted, posing challenges for achieving load balancing
                                        without overloading devices. Existing work predominantly focuses
                                        on cloud environments, overlooking DAF operator placement in
                                        resource-constrained and unreliable geo-distributed settings.

                                        This paper presents NEMO, a resource-aware optimization ap-
                                        proach that determines the replication factor and placement of
                                        DAF operators in resource-constrained geo-distributed topologies.
                                        Leveraging Euclidean embeddings of network topologies and a set
                                        of heuristics, NEMO scales to millions of nodes and handles topo-
                                        logical changes through adaptive re-placement and re-replication
                                        decisions. Compared to existing solutions, NEMO achieves up to
                                        6Ã— lower latency and up to 15Ã— reduction in communication cost,
                                        while preventing overloaded nodes. Moreover, NEMO re-optimizes
                                        placements in constant time, regardless of the topology size. As a
                                        result, it lays the foundation to efficiently process continuous data
                                        streams on large, heterogeneous, and geo-distributed topologies.

                                        <b>Abstract:</b> Modern multi-tiered data storage systems optimize file access
                                        by managing data across a hybrid composition of caches and storage tiers while
                                        using policies whose decisions can severely impact the storage systemâ€™s
                                        performance. Recently, different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been used
                                        to model access patterns from complex workloads. Yet, current approaches train
                                        their models offline in a batch-based approach, even though storage systems are
                                        processing a stream of file requests with dynamic workloads. In this manuscript,
                                        we advocate the streaming ML paradigm for modeling access patterns in
                                        multi-tiered storage systems as it introduces various advantages, including high
                                        efficiency, high accuracy, and high adaptability. Moreover, representative file
                                        access patterns, including temporal, spatial, length, and frequency patterns,
                                        are identified for individual files, directories, and file formats, and used as
                                        features. Streaming ML models are developed, trained, and tested on different
                                        file system traces for making two types of predictions: the next offset to be
                                        read in a file and the future file hotness. An extensive evaluation is performed
                                        with production traces provided by Huawei Technologies, showing that the models
                                        are practical, with low memory consumption (
                                        <1.3 MB) and low training delay (<1.8 ms per training instance), and can make

                                        include transferring data from operational systems to consolidated data
                                        warehouse environments, or from relational database systems to data lakes for
                                        exploratory data analysis or ML model training. Traditional data transfer
                                        approaches rely on efficient point-to-point connectors or general middleware
                                        with generic intermediate data representations. Physical environments (e.g.,
                                        on-premise, cloud, or consumer nodes) also have become increasingly
                                        heterogeneous. Existing work still struggles to achieve both, fast and scalable
                                        data transfer as well as generality in terms of heterogeneous systems and
                                        environments. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a holistic data transfer
                                        framework. Our XDBC framework splits the data transfer pipeline into logical
                                        components and provides a wide variety of physical implementations for these
                                        components. This design allows a seamless integration of different systems as
                                        well as the automatic optimizations of data transfer configurations according to
                                        workload and environment characteristics. Our evaluation shows that XDBC
                                        outperforms state-of-the-art generic data transfer tools by up to 5x, while

                                        <b>Abstract:</b> This paper presents an in-memory, RDMA-enabled,
                                        highly-available, transactional Key-Value Store (KVS), dubbed Dandelion, that
                                        significantly improves performance in small deployments (e.g., 5-10 machines).
                                        Small deployments are motivated by the anticipated memory expansion (e.g.,
                                        through CXL), which enables the deployment of in-memory KVSes with few machines
                                        but lots of memory.

                                        A small deployment presents locality opportunities that have not been examined
                                        by related work.
                                        Specifically, it is more likely that at any given time, we must send multiple
                                        messages to the same recipient. We leverage this by transparently batching
                                        multiple requests in the same network packet. Similarly, there is a greater
                                        chance of having
                                        multiple requests that can be served by the local hashtable without going
                                        through the network.
                                        Sending all requests to the hashtable as a batch allows it to overlap their
                                        memory latencies through software prefetching. Finally, it is more likely that
                                        the node that requests a key is itself a backup of that key. We leverage this by
                                        allowing strongly-consistent local reads from backups.

                                        Our evaluation shows that these optimizations result in up to 6.5x throughput
                                        improvement over a state-of-the-art system, FaSST, in OLTP workloads in a
                                        5-machine deployment. We characterize the impact and scalability of each of
                                        these optimizations with up to 10 machines -- where Dandelion still offers as
                                        much as 3.5x higher throughput than FaSST.<br />

                                        <b>Abstract:</b> Memory Disaggregation decouples memory from traditional
                                        datacenter servers, offering a promising pathway for achieving very high
                                        availability in transactional in-memory disaggregated Key-Value Stores (DKVSes).
                                        Achieving such availability hinges on transactional protocols that can
                                        efficiently handle failures in this setting where compute and memory are
                                        independent.

                                        However, existing transactional protocols overlook the scenario where compute
                                        and memory fail independently. Exacerbating the problem, memory disaggregation
                                        relies on memory nodes with limited compute capacity, requiring one-sided
                                        RDMA-style protocols instead of traditional RPC-based approaches. This
                                        significantly complicates achieving a correct and recoverable protocol due to
                                        the limited semantics of one-sided RDMA. Moreover, the only state-of-the-art
                                        one-sided transactional protocol has overlooked recovery, jeopardizing
                                        correctness and performance.

                                        We present Pandora, the first one-sided transactional protocol that is
                                        specifically designed to enable fast and correct recovery on disaggregated
                                        KVSes. Pandora's fast recovery hinges on two innovations: (a) the PILL
                                        (Pandora's Implicit Latch Logging), a novel technique for managing latches in
                                        the presence of compute failures; and (b) an RDMA-based recovery algorithm that
                                        detects and quickly recovers from failures.
                                        To validate that Pandora recovers correctly in the presence of failures, we
                                        introduce a new litmus-testing framework for end-to-end validation of
                                        transactional protocols. Our evaluation (and validation) reveals that Pandora
                                        achieves fast and correct recovery in the range of a few milliseconds without
                                        compromising the performance of failure-free runtime execution.<br />

                                        describe selected research contributions to achieve that goal. I first highlight
                                        work on using query feedback in order to improve the cardinality model of a
                                        relational query optimizer. I then will discuss how the research vision of the
                                        Stratosphere research project at TU Berlin lead to the creation of the data
                                        stream processing system Apache Flink. As a third contribution, I will discuss
                                        how fractal space-filling curves can be used to efficiently process
                                        multidimensional range queries. I will conclude by giving an outlook on
                                        NebulaStream, a novel data processing system to handle massively distributed
                                        data streams on heterogeneous devices.

                                        <b>Abstract:</b> Internet of Things (IoT)
                                        applications make use of live data from numerous sensors that reside outside
                                        cloud datacenters. As a result, it is imperative for IoT data management systems
                                        to reduce their network footprint while simultaneously scaling to larger numbers
                                        of sensors. One way of achieving this is to adapt data generation to the rate of
                                        changes in the real world. In this systems paper, we propose Chameleon, a
                                        sensor-driven protocol for network-efficient data management that treats sensors
                                        as first-class components of a stream processing system. Chameleon combines
                                        local knowledge from the sensors with global knowledge
                                        from the cloud to improve data acquisition. Our empirical evaluation shows that
                                        systems employing Chameleon outperform baselines for aggregate queries by up to
                                        one order of magnitude in terms of network utilization while keeping query
                                        results similar with negligible difference (down to 0.8%) from baselines.
                                        Chameleon enables data management systems to handle up to 80% more sensors
                                        without needing extra network resources.

                                        spatial adaptive indexing methods cater to static data made available in an
                                        one-off manner. To date, no spatial adaptive indexing method can ingest data
                                        updates interleaved with data exploration. In this paper we introduce GLIDE, a
                                        novel method that intertwines the adaptive indexing and incremental updating of
                                        a spatial-object data set. GLIDE builds a hierarchical spatial index
                                        incrementally in response to queries and also ingests updates judiciously into
                                        it. We examine several design choices and settle for a variant that combines
                                        gradual self-driven top-down insertions with query-driven indexing operations.
                                        In an extensive experimental comparison, we show that GLIDE achieves a lower
                                        cumulative cost than upfront-indexing methods and adaptive-indexing baselines.

                                        <b>Abstract:</b> Approximating a series of timestamped data points through a
                                        sequence of line segments with a maximum error guarantee is a fundamental data
                                        compression problem, termed as Piecewise Linear Approximation (PLA). As the
                                        demand for analyzing large volumes of time-series data across various domains
                                        continues to grow, the significance of this problem has recently received
                                        considerable attention. Recent PLA algorithms have emerged to help us handle the
                                        overwhelming amount of information, albeit at the expense of some precision
                                        loss. More precisely, these algorithms involve a delicate balance between the
                                        maximum acceptable precision loss and the space savings that can be achieved. In
                                        our recent work we proposed Sim-Piece, offering a fresh perspective on the
                                        long-standing challenge of PLA approximation. Sim-Piece identifies similarities
                                        among line segments in a PLA representation enabling their grouping and joint
                                        representation. This way, Sim-Piece delivers space-saving advantages that
                                        outperform even the optimal PLA approximation. In this work, we present
                                        Mix-Piece, an improved PLA compression algorithm that builds upon the core idea
                                        of Sim-Piece (i.e., exploiting similar PLA segments) but improves further its
                                        performance by (1) considering multiple candidate PLA segments when ingesting a
                                        time series, (2) enabling grouping of additional segments not utilized by
                                        Sim-Piece, and, (3) making use of a versatile output format that exploits all
                                        segment similarities. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that Mix-Piece
                                        outperforms Sim-Piece and previous competing techniques, attaining compression
                                        ratios with more than twofold improvement on average over what PLA algorithms
                                        can offer. This allows for providing significantly higher accuracy with
                                        equivalent space requirements.

                                        <b>Abstract:</b> Distance queries, including distance-range queries, k-nearest
                                        neighbors search, and distance joins, are very popular in spatial databases.
                                        However, they have been studied mainly for point data. Inspired by a recent
                                        approach on indexing non-point objects for rectangular range queries, we propose
                                        a secondary partitioning approach for space-partitioning indices, which is
                                        appropriate for distance queries. Our approach classifies the contents of each
                                        primary partition into 16 secondary partitions, taking into consideration the
                                        begin and end values of objects with respect to the spatial extent of the
                                        primary partition. Based on this, we define algorithms for three popular spatial
                                        query types, that avoid duplicate results and skip unnecessary computations. We
                                        compare our approach to the previous secondary partitioning method and to
                                        state-of-the-art data-partitioning indexing and find that it has a significant
                                        performance advantage.

                                        <b>Abstract:</b> Parallel spatial join algorithms are essential for scalable
                                        processing and analysis of big spatial data. The state-of-the-art algorithms
                                        rely on splitting the data into partitions and replicating objects from one data
                                        set in neighboring partitions, so that partitions can be processed in parallel
                                        independently without producing duplicate results. However, this universal
                                        replication of one data set leads to suboptimal performance in the case of
                                        skewed data sets with varying density. Instead, we advocate an approach that
                                        adaptively selects which data set to replicate in different local areas of the
                                        space, thus minimizing replication and boosting the performance of query
                                        processing. To this end, we contrive a graph-based framework for modeling
                                        replication between neighboring partitions. We study the theoretical properties
                                        that lead to adaptive replication with correct and duplicate-free results. Then,
                                        we design a data-parallel algorithm in Apache Spark which is based on adaptive
                                        replication, and we demonstrate its performance gain over the state-of-the-art
                                        for large-sized data sets, real and synthetic, under various settings.<br />

                                        <b>Abstract:</b> Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving at
                                        an unprecedented pace, with new models emerging almost
                                        daily. This has created a significant challenge for users trying
                                        to identify the most suitable model for a given task. With
                                        thousands of models available, selecting the right LLM has
                                        become increasingly complex. Retraining or fine-tuning a single
                                        model for general-purpose use is computationally expensive,
                                        making specialized models a practical necessity. However, the
                                        lack of tools to dynamically evaluate and combine these models
                                        limits their accessibility and effectiveness. In this paper, we
                                        introduce LLM Meta Search (LLM-MS), a web-based multi-
                                        model system that dynamically selects and allocates resources
                                        to LLMs based on query characteristics. To achieve this, we
                                        propose novel LLM selection algorithms that optimize token
                                        allocation, balancing response accuracy and computational cost.
                                        Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-MS significantly reduces
                                        token usage and response time compared to traditional single-
                                        model approaches while maintaining high-quality outputs.<br />

                                        <b>Abstract:</b> We introduce oblivious parallel operators designed for both
                                        non-foreign key and foreign key equi-joins. Obliviousness
                                        ensures nothing is revealed about the data besides input/output
                                        sizes, even against a strong adversary that can observe
                                        memory access patterns. Our solution achieves this by combining
                                        trusted hardware with efficient oblivious primitives
                                        for compaction and sorting, and two oblivious algorithms:
                                        (i) an oblivious aggregation tree, which can be described as
                                        a variation of the parallel prefix sum, customized for trusted
                                        hardware, and (ii) a novel algorithm for obliviously expanding
                                        the elements of a relation. In the sequential setting, our
                                        oblivious join performs 4.6Ã—- 5.14Ã— faster than the prior
                                        state-of-the-art solution (Krastnikov et al., VLDB 2020) on
                                        data sets of size n = 2^24. In the parallel setting, our algorithm
                                        achieves a speedup of up to roughly 16Ã— over the sequential
                                        version, when running with 32 threads (becoming up to 80Ã—
                                        compared to the sequential algorithm of Krastnikov et al.).
                                        Finally, our oblivious operators can be used independently to
                                        support other oblivious relational database queries, such as
                                        oblivious selection and oblivious group-by.<br />

                                        contain multiple copies of the same data tuple, reflecting real-world database
                                        systems more accurately. Deciding containment under bag-semantics (or simply,
                                        bag-containment) for two conjunctive queries (CQs) requires determining whether
                                        the answer of the first query, taking multiplicities into account, is contained
                                        within the answer of the second query, across all databases. Despite numerous
                                        attempts in the last thirty years, this problem of determining decidability and
                                        complexity of this task remains open as one of the prominent challenges in
                                        database theory, given its relevance in important applications. Previous works
                                        have established the decidability of the problem for specific classes of
                                        queries, among which is the the bag-containment of projection-free queries
                                        (PFQs), i.e., queries without existentially quantified variables, into general
                                        CQs. In this work, we push the boundaries further by addressing a broader, yet
                                        natural, fragment of CQs, called join-on free queries (JoFQ), which allows
                                        existential variables, while prohibiting joins involving them. We prove
                                        decidability of bag-containment of a JoFQ within a general CQ, placing the
                                        complexity of the problem in the first non-deterministic layer of the
                                        exponential hierarchy. The approach involves a homomorphism-counting reduction
                                        to the solution of a system of Diophantine inequalities with a specific
                                        structure (an undecidable problem in its general form) and an algorithm designed
                                        to address this category of inequalities.<br />

                                        <b>Abstract:</b> Modern analytics rely on insights derived from the execution of
                                        inference queries over vast amounts of unstructured data such as text, images,
                                        and video. Oftentimes, these queries evaluate predicates based on an expensive
                                        "oracle" model in the likes of a deep neural network or human input that
                                        dominates the total query cost. Prior work has focused on training
                                        computationally cheap proxy models at query time that produce an approximate
                                        result. Alternatively, index-based methods apply the original oracle over a
                                        representative set of data points and generate the approximate result through an
                                        inference propagation process. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) index-based
                                        methods require a memory-expensive index construction process which offsets
                                        their oracle cost-effectiveness and can make their usage prohibitive. In this
                                        work, we present HAIDES, an index-based, domain-agnostic framework for
                                        approximating inference on unstructured data. HAIDES consists of two main
                                        components: a coarse-to-fine framework that can be efficiently constructed using
                                        minimal memory, and a novel index adaptation component that makes use of oracle
                                        invocations during query execution in order to adaptively produce representative
                                        sets that yield high-quality approximate results. Our experimental results
                                        across three challenging domains-video, images, text-show that HAIDES (a)
                                        constructs indexes that produce performant representative sets with up to 2
                                        orders of magnitude less memory than the SOTA baseline, while (b) requires up to
                                        2x less oracle calls to produce the same result quality, and (c) achieves up to
                                        10 percentage points better result quality when using the same oracle
                                        calls.<br />

                                        these systems play a vital role in determining their performance as well as the

                                        <b>Abstract:</b> Data practitioners often sample their datasets to produce
                                        representative subsets for their downstream tasks. When entities in a dataset
                                        can be partitioned into multiple groups, stratified sampling is commonly used to
                                        produce subsets that match a target distribution, e.g., to select a balanced
                                        dataset for training a machine learning model. However, real-world data
                                        frequently contains duplicates - multiple representations of the same real-world
                                        entity - that can bias sampling, necessitating deduplication.

                                        We define deduplicated sampling as the task of producing a clean sample from a
                                        dirty dataset according to a target distribution. The naÃ¯ve approach to
                                        deduplicated sampling would first deduplicate the entire dataset upfront, then
                                        perform sampling ex post. However, that approach might be prohibitively
                                        expensive for large datasets and time/resource constraints. Deduplicated
                                        sampling on-demand with RadlER is a novel approach to produce a clean sample by
                                        focusing the cleaning effort only on entities required to appear in that sample.
                                        Our experimental evaluation, performed on multiple datasets from different
                                        domains, demonstrates that RadlER consistently outperforms the baseline
                                        approaches, providing data scientists with an efficient solution to quickly
                                        produce clean samples out of dirty data according to a target group
                                        distribution.

                                        <b>Abstract:</b> OpenData authors often supplement their datasets with attribute
                                        metadata described in CSV files. However, authors rarely adhere to common
                                        metadata publishing standards. This makes consuming such metadata more
                                        difficult, for example, when trying to use them to integrate tables from
                                        different sources. In this work, we highlight the novel problem of metadata
                                        unification. We first formulate attribute metadata unification in Open Data, and
                                        show that classic schema matching techniques meant for matching data tables
                                        perform poorly in this setting. Next, we propose a unified model for Open Data
                                        attribute metadata. Finally, we describe Gnomon, a strong baseline approach for
                                        metadata unification. We manually annotate 218 files split for development and
                                        test, and show that Gnomon is 31-32 percentage points more accurate than
                                        standard schema matching approaches. We are making available both Gnomon and the
                                        metadata unification data set as open source.

                                        training sets, specifically mislabeled and anomalous samples. Detection of data
                                        glitches provides insights into the quality of the data sampling. Their repair
                                        may improve the reliability and the performance of the model. The proposed
                                        methodology is based on exploiting influence functions that estimate how much
                                        the loss of the model (or a given sample) is affected when a sample is removed
                                        from the training set. We introduce three novel signals for detecting,
                                        characterizing, and repairing data glitches in a training set based on sample
                                        influences. Influence-based signals form an explainable-by-design data glitch
                                        detection framework, producing intuitively explainable signals of the actual
                                        predictive model built. In contrast, specialized algorithms that are agnostic to
                                        the target ML model (e.g., anomaly detectors) replicate the work of fitting the
                                        data distribution and may detect glitches that are inconsistent with the
                                        decision boundary of the predictive model. Computational experiments on tabular
                                        and image data modalities demonstrate that the proposed signals outperform, in
                                        some cases up to a factor of 6, all existing influence-based signals, and
                                        generalize across different datasets and ML models. In addition, they often
                                        outperform specialized glitch detectors (e.g., mislabeled and anomaly detectors)
                                        and provide accurate label repairs for mislabeled samples.<br />

                                        <b>Abstract:</b> This work investigates the challenge of accurately and
                                        efficiently answering complex SPJ (Select-Project-Join) queries issued directly
                                        on top of dirty data. We introduce QueryER , a novel framework that seamlessly
                                        integrates Entity Resolution (ER) into traditional query processing. QueryER
                                        performs analysis-aware deduplication by incorporating ER operators into the
                                        query plan, enabling efficient entity resolution over dirty data containing
                                        duplicate entries with minimal pre-processing time and no manual preparation
                                        overhead. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation, conducted using both
                                        real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrates that QueryER adapts to the
                                        workload, exhibits sub-linear scalability, and consistently achieves high recall
                                        performance, outperforming baseline approaches. The results attest to the
                                        robustness of QueryER and its suitability for data exploration and analysis
                                        workflows. This work opens up new possibilities for more efficient query
                                        processing over dirty data, particularly in the realm of data analysis and

                                        dynamic programming and need to work within the constraints of low-memory
                                        devices. This talk presents two solutions that enhance space-efficiency in such
                                        tasks. First, we will show how to achieve space-efficient Viterbi decoding, used
                                        in speech recognition and probabilistic context-free grammar parsing. Second, we
                                        will outline how to make optimal planning decisions space-efficiently in a
                                        finite-horizon Markov Decision Process. Thereby, we will showcase how data
                                        management expertise can deliver solutions in other domains. Lastly, we will
                                        glimpse into alternative time-efficient strategies for those problems.

                                        the analytics of textual information with topic discovery and sentiment analysis
                                        for a fixed time period. These frameworks also tend to focus on serving the
                                        purpose of a specific domain and terminology. In this study, we focus on a
                                        facilitation service to track discovered topics and their sentiments over time.
                                        This service is generic and can be applied to different domains. To evaluate the
                                        capabilities of the framework, we used two datasets with opposite types of
                                        wording. The study shows that the framework is capable of discovering similar
                                        topics over time and identifying their sentiment changes.

                                        <b>Abstract:</b> Clustering plays a crucial role in computer science,
                                        facilitating data analysis and problem-solving across numerous fields. By
                                        partitioning large datasets into meaningful groups, clustering reveals hidden
                                        structures and relationships within the data, aiding tasks such as unsupervised
                                        learning, classification, anomaly detection, and recommendation systems.
                                        Particularly in relational databases, where data is distributed across multiple
                                        tables, efficient clustering is essential yet challenging due to the
                                        computational complexity of joining tables. This paper addresses this challenge
                                        by introducing efficient algorithms for $k$-median and $k$-means clustering on
                                        relational data without the need for pre-computing the join query results. For
                                        the relational $k$-median clustering, we propose the first efficient
                                        multiplicative approximation algorithm. For the relational $k$-means clustering,
                                        our algorithm significantly improves both the approximation factor and the
                                        running time of the known relational $k$-means clustering algorithms, which
                                        suffer either from large constant approximation factors, or expensive running
                                        time. Given a join query $\Q$ over a database $\I$ of $O(N)$ tuples, for both
                                        $k$-median and $k$-means clustering, over the results of $\Q$ on $\I$, we
                                        propose randomized $(1+\eps)\gamma$-approximation algorithms that run in roughly
                                        $O(k^2N^{\fhw})+T_\gamma(k^2)$ time, where $\eps\in (0,1)$ is a constant
                                        parameter decided by the user, $\fhw$ is the fractional hyper-tree width of
                                        $\Q$, while $\gamma$ and $T_\gamma(x)$ are respectively the approximation factor
                                        and the running time of a traditional clustering algorithm in the standard
                                        computational model over $x$ items.<br />
